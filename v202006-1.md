# TFE Release v202006-1


APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:



APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added support for intiating plans and applies using the `-target` option via the API and the Terraform CLI (requires Terraform 0.12.26).
1. Changed organization token permissions to allow management of organization memberships.
1. Added support for remote Sentinel module sources.
1. Added additional retry attempts when retrieving a list of changed files from GitLab.
1. Added ability to create and destroy run triggers using an organization token
1. Added the ability to use Sentinel modules outside the root of a VCS policy set's "policies directory" (example: including `../modules/bar.sentinel` in a VCS policy set with a policy directory of "foo"). This allows multiple VCS policy sets within a single repository to share modules. Note that existing VCS policy sets will need to push an update to take advantage of this functionality.
1. Added the ability to include Sentinel module files remotely, similar to remote sources for policies.
1. Added the ability to supply alternate local sources for Sentinel policy files. You can now use the `source` parameter to specify a local path anywhere within the policy set's repository.
1. Added custom access level to Team Access, giving workspace admins the ability to grant finer-grained permissions to teams on their workspaces.
1. Added increased V2 API performance via systemic query optimizations.


APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed error pricing dynamodb resources that don't have read/write capacity set.
1. Fixed inaccurate marking of runs as planning/applying when they are actually still queued.
1. Fixed a bug that allowed the VCS Connection Creation wizard to connect to provider multiple times.
1. Changed Slack notification external documentation link
1. Fixed inbound and outbound workspace/run links that wouldn't render if a user didn't have permissions to the workspace.
1. Fixed race condition which caused Terraform to be unable to execute a run when using the remote backend due to the queue endpoint being unavailable.

APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Fixed an issue where 2FA mandatory organization requirements weren't being adhered to.

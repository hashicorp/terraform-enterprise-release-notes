DEPRECATION NOTICES:

The following operating systems are deprecated and are no longer supported.

- Debian 8, 9
- Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04
- Amazon Linux 2014.03, 2014.09, 2015.03, 2015.09, 2016.03, 2016.09, 2017.03, 2017.09, 2018.03

PostgreSQL server version 10 is deprecated and is no longer supported.

UPCOMING DEPRECATION NOTICES:

The January 2023 release of Terraform Enterprise will no longer support PostgreSQL server version 11. If you are using an external PostgreSQL server with your Terraform Enterprise installation, you must upgrade to PostgreSQL server version 12 or later.

APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. The [State Versions API](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/api-docs/state-versions#create-a-state-version) endpoint now accepts an optional `json-state` attribute when creating a state version. The `json-state` attribute is a Base64 encoded string containing the JSON format of the Terraform state file as expressed by `terraform show -json`. Runs using Terraform version 1.3+ will set this `json-state` attribute when creating a state version which can then be used by Terraform Enterprise integrations.
1. You can now query by `name` and `email` when listing organizations using the [Organizations API](https://www.terraform.io/cloud-docs/api-docs/organizations) endpoint.
1. You can now forcefully cancel policy checks on Terraform runs.

-> **Note:** This release contains a data migration that will lengthen the upgrade process. You can expect it to take roughly 1-2 minutes per 5,000 organizations.

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. When comparing JSON-encoded arrays with null values, the structured run output now displays the resource diff under the `plan finished` tab without errors. Previously, the structured run output contained errors for `aws_ecs_task_definition` resources with empty `container_definitions`.
1. Resource status badges are now vertically aligned in structured run output, regardless of the length of the resource name.
1. The UI now displays output from apply operations without depending on the actual values of sensitive data. Previously, run logs contained the plaintext value of sensitive outputs. Terraform version 1.4+ omits all sensitive output values in the downloaded run logs.
1. Enabling workload identity in workspaces with policy checks no longer causes runs to stop responding and eventually fail.
1. Run tasks now timeout after 10 minutes, preventing runs from staying in a pending state indefinitely. 
1. Workspace outputs of type `object` with keys containing dashes will no longer be `null` when you view them using `terraform output`.
1. Terraform Enterprise provides more informative errors when it cannot archive a configuration version.

APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Container updates address reported vulnerabilities (CVEs) in underlying packages and dependencies.
1. Fluent Bit is updated to version 1.9.7.

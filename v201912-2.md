# TFE Release v201912-2


BUG FIXES SINCE V201912-1:

1. Clustered upgrades start properly.

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:
1. Removed references to inaccessible hosted files from the old, deprecated version of Terraform Enterprise
1. Removed inaccessible data from the older, deprecated Terraform Enterprise design. Note: The old design of Terraform Enterprise (V1) has been inaccessible for a long period; as such, this release will remove all data which is not associated to the new design (V2). Rest assured, none of this data is being used today, and you will not notice a difference in the application. If you need to retain any of this V1 data for compliance or other reasons, please take a snapshot or backup of your TFE installation's PostgreSQL database before upgrading.
